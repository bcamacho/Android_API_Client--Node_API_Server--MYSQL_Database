Android client was developed using Android studio version 1.1
You can obtain Android Studio for free from http://developer.android.com

I included the ability to store local data using shared preferences. Shared preferences are easy to use and help maintain data on the device. Just remember, Shared preferences uses a 'key' & "value" pair. In my example I created a separate class to control local data along with external data.

--Java
----LocalData
----ExternalData
----LoginActivity
